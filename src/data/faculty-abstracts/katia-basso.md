Katia Basso studies the process of differentiation of germinal center B cells and the mechanisms of malignant transformation leading to lymphomagenesis. Her interest is in dissecting the transcriptional networks that drive the normal B cell differentiation and are hijacked in lymphomas. Her research informs on lymphoma features that impact diagnostics and therapeutics.
